                        <strong>We Protect Children – It’s our job.</strong> Cybersmarties is for children only, meaning that no adult can get access to a child on our platform. According to UNICEF, there are 250,000 predators on the internet at any
                        one time who are using game networks, chat rooms and childrens apps to imitate a child so that they can get access to a child. Since COVID began there is a 400% increase in online predator as children are on the internet more
                        often. This is not possible on Cybersmarties as each child is authenticated as a real child, chats are restricted to the verified children in their class only as approved by teachers.

                        Cybersmarties is the first social network in the world to be endorsed by a National Police Force as being 100% safe. We were awarded this patent as a result of 2.5 years working with the An Garda Siochána (National Police
                        Force
                        of Ireland) Child Protection Unit. We are very proud to hold this patent.

                        <strong>Schools decide the boundaries:</strong>
                        When a school signs up with Cybersmarties, they decide how far a student can communicate for example a teacher can decide to allow students to communicate with the kids in their class only, other classes or the whole school.
                        The school is always in control. In general most schools allow the kids in each class to communicate with the other kids in their class only.

                        <strong>We want a Different World for Children:</strong>
                        Everyone knows that social media and networks have resulted in terrible cyberbullying on a global scale. Cybersmarties uses behavioural technology to educate children as they are sending messages to their friends and
                        identifies if it is negative and wont allow the message to be sent until it is corrected. On a daily basis, it tells children why friends might be upset if they send a negative message and promotes positive online behaviour.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Positive Mental Health:</strong> There is a growing concern about the rising levels of mental health issues among young children. To combat this, Cybersmarties has a Wellbeing Assistant called Claire (A Cartoon
                        Character) who pops in each day to every child and asks them how their day is going. If they are experiencing problems or anxiety, they will be shown a video on how to deal with that problem so children learn the key skills on
                        how to deal with emotional problems early.

                        <strong>Healthy Mind is a Healthy Body:</strong>
                        At Cybersmarties we believe that there is a time and a place for everything and it is important that children keep fit and healthy. There are lots of fitness videos for children to follow which are fun and easy to follow at
                        home or in school. We also have nutritional and healthy eating videos for children to watch.

                  confidence. We provide videos on meditation (proven in UK schools to help calm children and
                  help them concentrate), nutrition, physical education, learn how to code to help logic and
                  reasoning skills, and so much more. Of course, we also have Claire Bot, who checks in on each
                  child every day to ask them how their day is going and provides useful videos on how to deal
                  with particular issues such as anxiety. Cybersmarties encourages continuous positivity
                  in a locked-down safe space to allow kids to be kids. <br> <br>
                  <strong>POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH:</strong> <br> <br>
                  There is a growing concern about the rising levels of mental
                  health issues among young children. To combat this,
                  Cybersmarties has a Wellbeing Assistant called Claire (A
                  Cartoon Character) who pops in each day to every child and
                  asks them how their day is going. If they are experiencing
                  problems or anxiety, they will be shown a video on how to deal
                  with that problem, so children learn the key skills on how to deal
                  with emotional problems early. <br> <br>
                  <strong>HEALTHY MIND IS A HEALTHY BODY:</strong> <br> <br>
                  At Cybersmarties we believe that there is a time and a place for
                  everything and it is important that children keep fit and healthy.
                  There are lots of fitness videos for children to follow which are
                  fun and easy to follow at home or in school. We also have
                  nutritional and healthy eating videos for children to watch.

                <img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail mx-auto mb-4 d-block" src="img/features/fc8.jpeg" alt="">
                <div class="modal-para-content">
                  <p>One in three young people in 30 countries said they have been a victim of online bullying, with one in five reporting having skipped school due to cyberbullying and violence, in a new poll released by UNICEF
                    and
                    the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) on Violence against Children. <br> <br>
                    Almost three-quarters of young people also said social networks, including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter, are the most common place for online bullying. <br> <br>
                    “Connected classrooms mean school no longer ends once a student leaves class, and, unfortunately, neither does schoolyard bullying,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Improving young people’s education experience
                    means
                    accounting for the environment they encounter online as well as offline.” <br> <br>
                    Through the poll, young people were asked via SMS and instant messaging technology a series of questions relating to their experiences of online bullying and violence, where it most frequently happens, and who they think is
                    responsible for ending it. Some 32 per cent of those polled believe governments should be responsible for ending cyberbullying, 31 per cent said young people and 29 per cent said internet companies. <br> <br>
                    “One of the key messages that we can clearly see from their opinions is the need for children and young people involvement and partnering: When asked who should be responsible for ending cyberbullying, the opinions were equally
                    divided between governments, internet service providers (private sector) and young people themselves,” said Najat Maalla Mjid, UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) on Violence against Children. “We are in this
                    together and we must share the responsibility in partnership.” <br> <br>
                    The poll results challenge the notion that cyberbullying among classmates is a uniquely high-income issue. For example, 34 per cent of respondents in sub-Saharan Africa said they had been a victim of online bullying. Some 39 per
                    cent said they knew about private online groups inside the school community where children share information about peers for the purpose of bullying. <br> <br>
                    As part of UNICEF’s campaign to #ENDviolence in and around schools, children and young people from around the world drafted an #ENDviolence Youth Manifesto in 2018, calling on governments, teachers, parents and each other to help
                    end violence and ensure students feel safe in and around school – including calling for protection online. <br> <br>
                    To end online bullying and violence in and around schools, UNICEF and partners are working with Cybersmarties for creating a safe and secure platform for all kids online. <br> <br>
                    Cybersmarties.com mission is to teach the next generation of internet users how to engage with social media in a positive manner so that the mistakes of the past do not become their future. Cybersmarties will be protecting a
                    million
                    kids online this year to make this space a safe heaven for children. <br> <br>
                    Cybersmarties will be working with The Willow Foundation and collaborating hand in hand with UNICEF and End Violence to calling for urgent action from all sectors in the following areas: <br> <br>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Implementation of policies to protect children and young people from cyberbullying and bullying.</li>
                    <li>Establishment and equipment of national helplines to support children and young people.</li>
                    <li>Advancement of ethical standards and practices of social network providers specifically in regards to the collection, information and management of data.</li>
                    <li>Collection of better, disaggregated evidence about children and young people’s online behaviour to inform policy and guidance.</li>
                    <li>Training for teachers and parents to prevent and respond to cyberbullying and bullying, particularly for vulnerable groups.</li>

                <div class="modal-para-content">
                  <p>Despite children’s massive online presence – 1 in 3 internet users worldwide is a child – too little is done to protect them from the perils of the digital world and to increase their access to safe online
                    content, UNICEF said in its annual flagship report released today. <br> <br>
                    The State of the World’s Children 2017: Children in a Digital World presents UNICEF’s first comprehensive look at the different ways digital technology is affecting children’s lives and life chances, identifying dangers as well as
                    opportunities. It argues that governments and the private sector have not kept up with the pace of change, exposing children to new risks and harms and leaving millions of the most disadvantaged children behind. <br> <br>
                    “For better and for worse, digital technology is now an irreversible fact of our lives,” said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. “In a digital world, our dual challenge is how to mitigate the harms while maximizing the
                    benefits
                    of the internet for every child.” <br> <br>
                    The report explores the benefits digital technology can offer the most disadvantaged children, including those growing up in poverty or affected by humanitarian emergencies. These include increasing their access to information,
                    building skills for the digital workplace, and giving them a platform to connect and communicate their views. <br> <br>
                    But the report shows that millions of children are missing out. Around one third of the world’s youth – 346 million – are not online, exacerbating inequities and reducing children’s ability to participate in an increasingly
                    digital
                    economy. <br> <br>
                    The report also examines how the internet increases children’s vulnerability to risks and harms, including misuse of their private information, access to harmful content, and cyberbullying. The ubiquitous presence of mobile
                    devices,
                    the report notes, has made online access for many children less supervised – and potentially more dangerous. <br> <br>
                    And digital networks like the Dark Web and cryptocurrencies are enabling the worst forms of exploitation and abuse, including trafficking and ‘made to order’ online child sexual abuse. <br> <br>
                    The report presents current data and analysis about children’s online usage and the impact of digital technology on children’s wellbeing, exploring growing debates about digital “addiction” and the possible effect of screen time
                    on
                    brain development. <br> <br>
                    Additional facts from the report include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Young people are the most connected age group. Worldwide, 71 per cent are online compared with 48 per cent of the total population.</li>
                    <li>African youth are the least connected, with around 3 out of 5 youth offline, compared to just 1 in 25 in Europe.</li>
                    <li>Approximately 56 per cent of all websites are in English and many children cannot find content they understand or that is culturally relevant.</li>
                    <li>More than 9 in 10 child sexual abuse URLs identified globally are hosted in five countries – Canada, France, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation and the United States.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Only collective action – by governments, the private sector, children’s organizations, academia, families and children themselves – can help level the digital playing field and make the internet safer and more accessible for
                    children, the report says. <br> <br>
                    Practical recommendations to help guide more effective policymaking and more responsible business practices to benefit children include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Provide all children with affordable access to high-quality online resources.</li>
                    <li>Protect children from harm online – including abuse, exploitation, trafficking, cyberbullying and exposure to unsuitable materials.</li>
                    <li>Safeguard children’s privacy and identities online.</li>
                    <li>Teach digital literacy to keep children informed, engaged and safe online.</li>
                    <li>Leverage the power of the private sector to advance ethical standards and practices that protect and benefit children online.</li>
                    <li>Put children at the centre of digital policy.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    “The internet was designed for adults, but it is increasingly used by children and young people – and digital technology increasingly affects their lives and futures. So digital policies, practices, and products should better
                    reflect children’s needs, children’s perspectives and children’s voices,” said Lake.
