                        <strong>We Protect Children – It’s our job.</strong> Cybersmarties is for children only, meaning that no adult can get access to a child on our platform. According to UNICEF, there are 250,000 predators on the internet at any
                        one time who are using game networks, chat rooms and childrens apps to imitate a child so that they can get access to a child. Since COVID began there is a 400% increase in online predator as children are on the internet more
                        often. This is not possible on Cybersmarties as each child is authenticated as a real child, chats are restricted to the verified children in their class only as approved by teachers.

                        Force
                        of Ireland) Child Protection Unit. We are very proud to hold this patent.

                        <strong>Schools decide the boundaries:</strong>
                        When a school signs up with Cybersmarties, they decide how far a student can communicate for example a teacher can decide to allow students to communicate with the kids in their class only, other classes or the whole school.
                        The school is always in control. In general most schools allow the kids in each class to communicate with the other kids in their class only.

                        <strong>We want a Different World for Children:</strong>
                        Everyone knows that social media and networks have resulted in terrible cyberbullying on a global scale. Cybersmarties uses behavioural technology to educate children as they are sending messages to their friends and
                        identifies if it is negative and wont allow the message to be sent until it is corrected. On a daily basis, it tells children why friends might be upset if they send a negative message and promotes positive online behaviour.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Positive Mental Health:</strong> There is a growing concern about the rising levels of mental health issues among young children. To combat this, Cybersmarties has a Wellbeing Assistant called Claire (A Cartoon
                        Character) who pops in each day to every child and asks them how their day is going. If they are experiencing problems or anxiety, they will be shown a video on how to deal with that problem so children learn the key skills on
                        how to deal with emotional problems early.

                        <strong>Healthy Mind is a Healthy Body:</strong>
                        At Cybersmarties we believe that there is a time and a place for everything and it is important that children keep fit and healthy. There are lots of fitness videos for children to follow which are fun and easy to follow at
                        home or in school. We also have nutritional and healthy eating videos for children to watch.
